The following is my implementation of a numerical solver for ordinary differential equations

Features Added
  - Solve a single first order differential equation
  - Solve a system of first order differential equations
  - Plot the solution of the differential equation
  - Plot the solution of the system of differential equations

Features to Add
  - Add support for higher order differential equations by converting them to a system of first order differential equations
  - create interpolation function to approximate the solution of the differential equation at any point
  - Add support for boundary value problems
